# Horiseon Code Refactor

Deployed link: https://beazach.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/

## Description 
The Horiseon site was structured around semantically meaningless containers, had limited accessibility and showed multiple CSS redundancies.

The refactor aimed to improve accessibility of the page and optimize it for search engines.

## Page Optimizations 
The following optimizations were implemented:

### Title 
The page received a descriptive title to improve SEO.

### HTML Code 
The HTML code was updated with semantic elements replacing non-semantic tags to give the page a logical structure and improve SEO.

Visual elements received accessible alt attributes to improve page accessibility.

### CSS Code 
The CSS Code was simplified with multiple classes streamlined into one class applying to all elements within a section.

Heading attributes were arranged in sequential order (h1, h2, h3)

## Usage
The look and feel of the page has not changed, as the optimizations affected only the underlying code rather than page functionality or layout.
